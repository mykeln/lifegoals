PRIMER
on first page load, the script generates a default image based on default text. The form follows the image. If the form is submitted, it re-renders the page with a different image based on the text that was entered.

TODO
- make canvas take up full viewport width
- let user enter text that fills the screen
- put a tiny download button in the corner that saves the image as a background on the phone
- dynamically set text size (and line height) to encompass the entire canvas
- allow user to pick background + text color
